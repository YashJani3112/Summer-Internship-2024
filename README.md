## Day 1-5: Orientation and Setup

### Tasks:
- Introduction to the team and company policies.
- Setup of development environment.
- Overview of the projects and tasks for the internship.
- Installation of necessary software and tools.

## Day 6-10: Password Checker

### Tasks:
- Learned about password security and common vulnerabilities.
- Developed a Password Checker in Python.
- Implemented checks for common password issues like length, character variety, and common patterns.
- Created a function to provide feedback on password strength.

### Files:
- `password_checker.py`

## Day 11-15: Implementation of Caesar Cipher

### Tasks:
- Studied the Caesar Cipher encryption method.
- Implemented the Caesar Cipher in Python.
- Created functions for both encryption and decryption.
- Developed a simple user interface for inputting text and displaying the results.

### Files:
- `caesar_cipher.py`

## Day 16-20: Code Review and Testing

### Tasks:
- Performed code reviews with mentors and peers.
- Conducted unit testing for both the Password Checker and Caesar Cipher projects.
- Fixed bugs and improved code quality based on feedback.

### Files:
- `test_password_checker.py`
- `test_caesar_cipher.py`

## Day 21-25: Optimization and Enhancements

### Tasks:
- Optimized code for better performance and readability.
- Added additional features to the Password Checker (e.g., checking against a database of common passwords).
- Enhanced the Caesar Cipher implementation with support for different shift values and character sets.

### Files:
- `password_checker.py` (updated)
- `caesar_cipher.py` (updated)

## Day 26-30: Documentation and Final Presentation

### Tasks:
- Created detailed documentation for both projects.
- Prepared a final presentation summarizing the work done during the internship.
- Presented the projects to the team and received feedback.

### Files:
- `README.md`
- `project_presentation.pptx`

## Conclusion
